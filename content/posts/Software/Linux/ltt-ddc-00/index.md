The Linus Tech Tips Daily Driver Challenge is an attempt at using a linux system as your main rig. The hard(er) mode version is using Arch and i3wm as the os of choice.

<!--more-->

Part 0 of this challenge will be testing the feasibility of arch-gaming using a kvm virtual machine. After successfully installing the os I will test installing and playing games through steam.

## The Edit

In spirit of the linux challenge, all the editing will be done using FOSS apps. On audio we have an audacity fork [Tenacity](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity) (Audacity seems to have spooky stuff going on lately), and on video we have the tried and true [kdenlive](https://github.com/KDE/kdenlive)!
